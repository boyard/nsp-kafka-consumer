# NSP Data Streaming Platform - LLM Session Context

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES STATUS

### Issue #1: Dynamic Topic Management Failure
**Problem**: When adding new topics during an active streaming session, message flow from the Kafka broker stops completely and never resumes.

**Symptoms**:
- User can add topics via interactive menu
- No error messages appear
- Message consumption stops entirely
- Consumer appears to be running but receives no messages
- Issue persists even after removing newly added topics

**Current Implementation**: Consumer recreation approach attempted but unsuccessful
**Impact**: Feature is unusable - dynamic topic management breaks core functionality

### Issue #2: Shutdown Process Hanging
**Problem**: CTRL+C signal does not properly terminate the consumer process.

**Symptoms**:
- CTRL+C appears to be received (consumer stops displaying messages)
- Process does not exit and hangs indefinitely
- Terminal becomes unresponsive to consumer
- Requires `kill -HUP` from another terminal to terminate
- Graceful shutdown mechanisms are not working

**Current Implementation**: Enhanced signal handling attempted but unsuccessful
**Impact**: Poor user experience - cannot cleanly exit application

## üéØ Project Overview

This is an **NSP (Nokia Network Services Platform) data streaming platform** that evolved from a focused fault management tool into a comprehensive telemetry and analytics system. The platform provides real-time streaming access to 167+ data streams across 10 categorized domains.

**Current Status**: Core streaming functionality works, but dynamic topic management and clean shutdown are broken.

### Evolution Timeline
- **v1.0.0**: Basic fault management with token manager and REST API access
- **v2.0.0**: Added Kafka consumer with SSL/TLS support
- **v3.0.0**: Expanded to comprehensive data streaming with topic categorization
- **v4.0.0**: Attempted robust consumer recreation and graceful shutdown (issues remain)

                                                  ‚ö†Ô∏è BROKEN: Dynamic topic changes stop flow

```

### Data Stream Categories (10 domains)
1. **Fault Management & Alarms** - Network health, fault notifications
2. **NSP Database Topics** - Database sync, state changes
3. **NSP Sync & Upload** - Data synchronization operations
4. **OAM Operations** - Operations, administration, maintenance
5. **Real-time Analytics** - KPIs, metrics, anomaly detection
6. **Sessions & Events** - User sessions, system events
7. **Service Operations** - Network service lifecycle
8. **Intent & Configuration** - Intent-based management
9. **System & Internal** - Internal processes, infrastructure
10. **Other Topics** - Specialized data streams

## üèóÔ∏è Key Technical Implementations

### Authentication & Security ‚úÖ WORKING
- **OAuth2 Flow**: Automated token refresh every 30 minutes via cron
- **SSL/TLS**: End-to-end encryption with certificate management
- **Token Storage**: INI-based persistence with error handling
- **Time Windows**: Melbourne timezone, 5 AM - 10 PM operational window

### Kafka Consumer Architecture ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY WORKING
- **Basic Streaming**: Initial topic subscription and message consumption works
- **Topic Discovery**: 167+ topic discovery and categorization works
- **Interactive Menu**: Category browsing and initial topic selection works
- **‚ùå Dynamic Management**: Adding topics during session breaks message flow
- **‚ùå Graceful Shutdown**: CTRL+C handling is broken and hangs process

### Interactive Features
- **Topic Categorization**: Smart filtering with keyword-based organization ‚úÖ
- **Navigation System**: Category browsing with 'back'/'quit' commands ‚úÖ
- **JSON Formatting**: Syntax-highlighted output for readability ‚úÖ
- **‚ùå Real-time Control**: Live topic management breaks streaming

## üîç Technical Analysis of Current Issues

### Issue #1: Dynamic Topic Management
**Root Cause Analysis Needed**:
- Kafka consumer group coordination problems?
- Offset management issues during subscription changes?
- Consumer state corruption during topic updates?
- Broker-side subscription handling problems?

**Attempted Solutions That Failed**:
- Consumer recreation (close old, create new)
- Offset commits before changes
- Unsubscribe delays and forced polling
- Subscription restoration on failure

### Issue #2: Shutdown Hanging
**Root Cause Analysis Needed**:
- Signal handling not properly implemented?
- Consumer polling loop not checking for shutdown signal?
- Thread synchronization issues?
- Kafka client cleanup hanging?

**Attempted Solutions That Failed**:
- Enhanced signal handling with SIGINT/SIGTERM
- Forced cleanup with timeout
- Emergency exit mechanisms
- Consumer close() with timeout

## üíª Development Environment

### Python Virtual Environment
```bash
# Location: /Users/engels/NSPlayground/KTnV/.venv
# Key packages:
- kafka-python==2.2.15    # Kafka client library
- requests==2.32.4        # HTTP client for OAuth2
- pytz==2025.2            # Timezone handling
- configparser            # Configuration management
```

### Configuration Management ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Central Config**: `nsp_config.ini` contains all endpoints, credentials, timeouts
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data handled via environment variables
- **SSL Certificates**: Managed in `certs/` directory with proper permissions

### Cron Job Integration ‚úÖ WORKING
```bash
# Current cron entry:
*/30 * * * * cd /Users/engels/NSPlayground/KTnV && /Users/engels/NSPlayground/KTnV/.venv/bin/python3 nsp_token_manager.py
```

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Test Suite Components
- `test_nsp_token_manager.py` - Token lifecycle testing ‚úÖ
- `test_complete_fm.py` - End-to-end workflow validation
- `test_location_services.py` - Location service integration
- `verify_nsp_token.py` - Token validation utility ‚úÖ
- `debug_subscriptions.py` - Subscription API debugging

### Current Validation Status
1. ‚úÖ Token manager creates/refreshes tokens successfully
2. ‚úÖ Kafka consumer connects and discovers topics
3. ‚úÖ Interactive menu navigation works correctly
4. ‚ùå Message streaming stops when topics are changed
5. ‚ùå Graceful shutdown hangs indefinitely
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic streaming works until dynamic changes are attempted

## üìä Current System Status

### Operational Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Functional with Critical Issues
- ‚úÖ Token refresh: Automated and stable
- ‚úÖ Initial Kafka streaming: Works for static topic sets
- ‚úÖ Topic discovery: All 167+ topics discoverable
- ‚ùå Dynamic topic management: Breaks message flow completely
- ‚ùå Shutdown process: Hangs and requires manual kill
- ‚úÖ SSL/TLS: Secure connections established

### Working Features
- ‚úÖ OAuth2 authentication and token management
- ‚úÖ SSL/TLS secure connections to NSP
- ‚úÖ Topic discovery and categorization
- ‚úÖ Initial topic subscription and streaming
- ‚úÖ JSON formatting and syntax highlighting
- ‚úÖ Interactive menu navigation

### Broken Features
- ‚ùå Dynamic topic addition during active session
- ‚ùå Clean application shutdown with CTRL+C
- ‚ùå Consumer recreation after topic changes
- ‚ùå Graceful error recovery from subscription changes

## üéØ Usage Patterns & Current Limitations

### What Works
```bash
# Start streaming with initial topic selection - WORKS
python3 nsp_kafka_consumer.py

# Select topics via interactive menu - WORKS
# View messages in real-time - WORKS

# What DOESN'T work:
# - Adding topics during session (breaks flow)
# - CTRL+C to exit (hangs, need kill -HUP)
```

### Development Commands ‚úÖ WORKING
```bash
# Manual token refresh
python3 nsp_token_manager.py

# Validate current token
python3 verify_nsp_token.py

# Run tests (most work)
python3 test_complete_fm.py
```

## üîÑ Immediate Development Priorities

### URGENT Issues to Fix
1. **Dynamic Topic Management**:
   - Investigate why consumer stops receiving messages after topic changes
   - Consider alternative approaches (separate consumers per topic?)
   - Debug Kafka consumer group coordination
   - Implement proper offset management during changes

2. **Shutdown Process**:
   - Fix CTRL+C signal handling
   - Ensure consumer polling loop checks for shutdown
   - Implement proper cleanup sequence
   - Add timeout mechanisms for hanging operations

### Investigation Areas
- **Kafka Consumer Group Behavior**: How does the broker handle subscription changes?
- **Offset Management**: Are offsets being corrupted during topic changes?
- **Thread Management**: Is there a threading issue causing hangs?
- **Consumer State**: What state gets corrupted during dynamic changes?

### Alternative Approaches to Consider
- **Static Topic Selection**: Remove dynamic topic management entirely
- **Multiple Consumers**: One consumer per topic instead of dynamic subscription
- **Consumer Pool**: Pre-create consumers for different topic sets
- **Restart-Based Changes**: Restart entire application for topic changes
